PyMC is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis.[5] It is a fast, well-maintained library. The only unfortunate part is that its documentation is lacking in certain areas, especially those that bridge the gap between beginner and hacker. One of this book’s main goals is to solve that problem, and also to demonstrate why PyMC is so cool.
We will model this problem using PyMC. This type of programming is called probabilistic programming, an unfortunate misnomer that invokes ideas of randomly generated code and has likely confused and frightened users away from this field. The code is not random; it is probabilistic in the sense that we create probability models using programming variables as the model’s components. Model components are first-class primitives within the PyMC framework.
